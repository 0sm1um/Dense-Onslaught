A new mutator mod which aims to offer a bridge between base Onslaught and Dutch Spice

[h1]Key Features:[/h1]

[b]Wave Composition:[/b] 
Dense Onslaught has a similar wave composition to Dutch Spice, the primary difference being that trash enemies spawn less frequently(which also aids performance). At a high level, Dense spawns 70% as many trash enemies, and 90% of the elites of Dutch.

[b]Special Spawning:[/b] 
Dense Onslaught aims to give players a taste of the increased special pressure which Dutch Spice is known for. To this end, Dense has 7 special slots, with minimum and maximum timers of 32 and 50 seconds respectively. These timers are the exact middle ground between base Onslaught and Dutch Spice, so backliners will have a lot more on their plate to deal with.

[b]Reworked Patrols:[/b] 
Dense Onslaught has completely new patrols unseen in any other mods. In order to offer patrols which are roughly the same difficulty between factions, I decided to take the Dutch Spice Super Armored Skaven patrol as the baseline difficulty I wanted each patrol to be. And using that as a baseline, I designed Chaos and Beastmen Patrols which contained a quantity of enemies comparable to Armored Skaven Patrols. I want pulling patrols to be a valid tactic for teams, but also making them difficult enough to where neither pulling nor avoiding would be the obvious best way to traverse most trigger zones. All patrols are the same length which should prevent them being unavoidable on some maps or getting stuck. There are also now only 1 patrol subtype for each faction. To compensate for the decrease of variety, I’ve made it so any patrol from any faction is permitted to spawn in any map. Note that Beastmen patrols contain all 3 factions for all you Beastmen haters out there.

[b]Monster Triggers:[/b]
Dense Onslaught has kept Monster triggers largely the same between other Onslaught variants with one key difference: Stormfiends now do not spawn during regular pacing. Stormfiends have long been acknowledged as the least challenging Monster, and in an effort to reduce run to run variance in difficulty on maps, I’ve decided to stop them spawning for standard monster triggers. They still however can (and will) spawn during events.

[b]Events:[/b] 
The design intent for most of the Dense Onslaught events is to emphasize the skills which are most valuable during regular pacing. In other words if a team is very good at pacing, ideally they should be able to perform well in an event they have never played before just from having a fundamentally sound skillset of fighting waves, kiting, and keeping specials under control. As such, I’ve drawn ideas from all three of the main Onslaught Mods, as well as implemented some new ideas of my own. In general, most strats which are optimal on Base Onslaught should still work on my mod. Though you might encounter more specials or the odd Stormfiend.

Though you will find that on events with highly variable/random elements(such as Monster Spawns), you will find that the easiest outcomes will usually be less common (for example, neither Bile Trolls nor Stormfiends can spawn on the Righteous Stand mid event).
